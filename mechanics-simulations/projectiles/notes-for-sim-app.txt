Here are some ideas for the interactive application concerning projectiles moving 
through media with drag. The main capabilities are to be:
    - varying of initial conditions, such as velocity, position, and launch angle
    - varying of dimensions of the sphere, as well as mass (or density)
    - varying of the linear and quadratic drag coefficients 
    - plotting of dragless, linear, quadratic and combined (both linear and quadratic) 
      trajectories 
    - a line and angle indicator
    - animation of the trajectory, comparing with dragless; should show time elapsed and velocities 
    - interactivity 
    

Other things that I would like to calculate:
    - problem 2.44 from taylor - varying drag coefficients

An aside:
    - dynamics of a raindrop falling --> one dimensional, but both linear and quadratic
