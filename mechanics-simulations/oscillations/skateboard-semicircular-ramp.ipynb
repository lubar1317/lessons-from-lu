    "## A classic problem\n",

    "Here I'm going to consider the half-pipe problem seen in Classical Mechanics by Taylor, Example 1.2. It consists of a skateboard in a semicircular half-pipe that is released at some angle $\\phi$ from equilibrium position. This problem is analogous to many others in classical mechanics, like the simple pendulum problem, a mass on a spring, etc. For the moment, we'll neglect friction. \n",
    "\n",
    "Through a straightforward analysis of the forces, we can arrive at the equation of motion for the angle the skateboard makes with the bottom of the pipe:\n",

    "\\ddot{\\phi} = -\\frac{g}{R}\\sin (\\phi)\n",

    "where $g$ is the gravitational constant, and $R$ is the radius of the pipe. \n",
