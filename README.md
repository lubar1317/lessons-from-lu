# lessons-from-lu

While studying and working in physics and math education over the past several years, I have noticed that students, including myself, would often benefit of interactive visuals in conjunction with the material that they are studying. This is often done in lectures if the instructor so decides to do so, but not always. As such, I have decided to do so for some lessons that I've found myself giving and which I think would benefit from such a mixture. 

For the moment, these have no particular structure, and may include topics I find physically or computationally interesting.
